To use delegatejs with prototype include:

	`<script type="text/javascript" src='somepath/delegate-generic.js'></script>`
	`<script type="text/javascript" src='somepath/delegate-prototype.js'></script>`

in you HTML.

To use delegatejs with mootools include:

	`<script type="text/javascript" src='../src/delegate-generic.js'></script>`
	`<script type="text/javascript" src='../src/delegate-mootools.js'></script>`


Now you can do event delegation in the following way:

<html>
	<head>
		<title>Event Delegation with Prototype</title>
		<script type="text/javascript" src='prototype.js'></script>
		<script type="text/javascript" src='delegate-generic.js'></script>
		<script type="text/javascript" src='delegate-prototype.js'></script>
		<script type="text/javascript">
			$('someDIV').delegate('submit', '.dont-submit', function(event){
				event.stop();
				alert('The form was not submitted!');
			});
		</script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<div id="someDIV">
			<form class="dont-submit">
				<input type="submit" value="Submit">
			</form>
			<form class="dont-submit">
				<input type="submit" value="Submit">
			</form>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>


delegatejs works for submit, change, focus and blur event - as well as all bubbling events.
